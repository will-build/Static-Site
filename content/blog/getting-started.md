# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static websites are making a comeback, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, and incredibly simple to maintain.

## What is a Static Site?

A static site consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to users without any server-side processing. Unlike dynamic sites that generate content on-demand, static sites are pre-built and served as-is.

## Benefits of Static Sites

### Performance
Static sites load incredibly fast because there's no server-side processing. The files are served directly from a CDN or web server.

### Security
With no server-side code or database, there are fewer attack vectors. Static sites are inherently more secure.

### Simplicity
No complex server setup, no database management, no server-side code to maintain.

### Cost
Static sites can be hosted for free or very cheaply on services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## When to Choose Static Sites

Static sites are perfect for:

- Personal blogs
- Documentation sites
- Marketing pages
- Portfolios
- Small business websites

They might not be ideal for:

- E-commerce sites with complex functionality
- Sites requiring user authentication
- Real-time applications
- Sites with frequently changing dynamic content

## Getting Started

The simplest way to start is with a static site generator like the one we've built here. Just create your content in Markdown, run the build process, and deploy the generated HTML files.
